# Erika's Lab

Erika's Lab is the Windows-first technical and gameplay foundation for the future Fimbul Winter game. Phase 1 establishes a small code-first C# architecture and proves that the project can render and move through a real 3D world.

The current platform implementation is MonoGame using its Windows DirectX backend. That choice is intentionally contained in the host project; reusable engine and game code does not depend on Windows, MonoGame input types, `GraphicsDevice`, or platform windowing. The longer-term goal is to keep enough of the core portable for future guideXOS Server work without designing that target prematurely.

## Architecture

```text
ErikasLab.Platform.MonoGame  Windows executable, MonoGame WindowsDX host
        ├── ErikasLab.Game   Phase 1 world/session and game-specific behavior
        └── ErikasLab.Engine Portable timing, input, camera, scene, mesh, renderer contracts
```

`ErikasLab.Engine` and `ErikasLab.Game` target `net8.0` and use `System.Numerics` plus project-owned data types. `ErikasLab.Platform.MonoGame` targets `net8.0-windows7.0`, references `MonoGame.Framework.WindowsDX` 3.8.4.1, and adapts the portable scene data to MonoGame vertex/index buffers and `BasicEffect`.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 22H2 or newer
- .NET 8 SDK or a newer SDK with the .NET 8 targeting/runtime packs
- .NET 8 Windows Desktop Runtime
- A DirectX-capable graphics adapter

The repository currently builds with .NET SDK 10.0.400 while targeting .NET 8.

## Restore, build, and run

From the repository root:

```powershell
dotnet restore ErikasLab.sln
dotnet build ErikasLab.sln --configuration Release
dotnet run --project src/ErikasLab.Platform.MonoGame/ErikasLab.Platform.MonoGame.csproj --configuration Release
```

The host is framework-dependent and uses the installed .NET 8 runtime. The project removes two legacy host files transitively supplied by the current WindowsDX package because they otherwise shadow the installed .NET host when launching the generated Windows executable directly.

## Controls

- `W` / `S`: move forward / backward
- `A` / `D`: strafe left / right
- Mouse: look around; the pointer is recentered while the game is focused
- Arrow keys: keyboard look fallback
- `Escape`: exit

Movement is driven by portable `FrameTime.DeltaSeconds`, so it is not frame-rate dependent.

## Phase 1 capabilities

- Three-project solution with a portable engine/game split and a WindowsDX host
- Perspective camera with position, yaw, pitch, field of view, aspect ratio, and near/far clip planes
- Ground plane plus five colored boxes at varied positions, depths, sizes, and elevation
- Depth buffering, back-face culling, basic directional lighting, and GPU vertex/index buffer caching
- Delta-time camera movement, mouse/keyboard look, resizable backbuffer projection updates, and startup diagnostics
- Clean restore/build with warnings treated as errors

Meshes are generated in code for this proof scene, so no content pipeline assets are required yet.

## Deferred work

Combat, inventory, AI, quests, complicated physics, networking, guideXOS support, character animation, Erika, production content, save/load, and a larger renderer/content system are intentionally deferred. The existing untracked `erika/` FBX asset directory is preserved locally and ignored from this bootstrap commit until an explicit asset-import phase.

## Repository hygiene

Build output (`bin/`, `obj/`), IDE state, temporary files, and the local `erika/` asset directory are ignored. The first Phase 1 commit is intentionally source-only.
